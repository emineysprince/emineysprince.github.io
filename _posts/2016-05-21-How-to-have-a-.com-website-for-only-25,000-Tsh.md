In this post I'll sound so miser (Bahili kama mchaga) but I am not that kind of, this website/blog costs me just 25,000 Tsh (around 11 USD) a year, hosting + ```.com``` domain name which is ```emineysprince.com```. I am not that way miser but I felt a push from my mind to create something different from my late website which was costing me 120,000 Tsh (around 53 USD) a year for hosting and domain name inclusive. That was too much money for me by the way, because I was just blogging on it, with no AddSense, so it was unusefully idea at a time for that cost.

## **Now how I get this cheepest website**

My desire was to have a dynamic website which I can use it to post my staffs like this in my own blog. I started to think and work on the idea, Firstly I ask my friend [Oscar Ollotu](https://oscarolotu.com) where should I get the cheepest ```.com``` domain name ? He answered me that, there is many of the service provider in Tanzania, but it cost 35,000 Tsh (arround 15 USD) for ```.com``` domain. But I felt it was also too much cost, so I dicided to look for the cheepest one else where. It came an idea that, let me buy a domain name without DNS which cost 25,000 Tsh from [Extream Webhosting Tanzania](http://www.extremewebtechnologies.com/). 

But the problem came, no website with without DNS setting. How I found free DNS for my domain name ?. I search it on google and I found this tool [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) to resolve a DNS settings for my domain name.

## **How about hosting now**

After having a domain name with DNS generated in Cloudflare, now how to have a really dynamic website. I came across with many free web hosting like [000webhosting](https://www.000webhost.com) and many others, but they didn't give me a freedom that way I ll enjoy my things up. But I finaly I meet my lovely friend [github](https://github.com/), GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service. It offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. Github gives a way to create a Static website which is [GitPage](https://pages.github.com). 

Ok now I have a git page, but is a Static web page, because Github doesn't allow the databse environment on gitpages. So I have to think on making my gitpage a Dynamic website. 

## **How a Gitpage can be a dynamic website**

All of those process is kind of boring thing, but only if you are kind of a person who don't care on spending much while there is a shourtcut to avoid it. Ok, how my Gitpage now become a dynamic website. I read about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites. Written in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) by [Tom Preston-Werner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Preston-Werner), GitHub's co-founder, it is distributed under an open source license. Once I knew Jekyll has got Ruby staffs on it, I was so much interested because I LIKE RUBY than any other programing languages, I was Inspired to learn Ruby with my Teacher [@Mtabe](http://watabelabs.com/). 

I use Jekyll to make things up and I got a dynamic webpage. Ok, its already a dynamic webpage, but to publish thing on it it just a complex staff you may not be interested to hear about. 

## **How you can publish posts on gitpage easly online**

To do this is like hacking ideas, what you are doing is accessing your repository away from github and publish post to your _post file_ on github. I am using this tool [Prose](http://prose.io), Prose is a content editor for GitHub designed for managing websites. Just create account and authorize access to your github account and make things happen that simple. 

I think this gonna be helpfully to you if you want to have a website/blog and you want to blog like an hacker, if facing any problem just leave a comment or just halla me on twitter [@emineysprince](https://twitter.com/emineysprince)
