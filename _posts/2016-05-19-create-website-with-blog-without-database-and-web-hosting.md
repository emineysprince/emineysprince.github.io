In this post I'll sound so miser (Bahili kama mchaga) but not that way, this website/blog costs me just 25,000 Tsh (around 11 USD) a year, hosting + ```.com``` domain name which is ```emineysprince.com```. I am not that way miser but I felt a push from my mind to create something different from my late website which was costing me 120,000 Tsh (around 53 USD) a year for hosting and domain name inclusive. That was too much money for me by the way, because I was just blogging on it, with no AddSense, so it was too much unusefull idea at a time for that cost.

## **Now how I get this cheepest website**

My desire was to have a dynamic website which I can use it to post my staffs like this in my own blog. I started to think and work on the idea, Firstly I ask my friend [Oscar Ollotu](https://oscarolotu.com) where should I get the cheepest ```.com``` domain name ? He answered me there is many of the service provider in Tanzania, but it cost 35,000 Tsh for ```.com``` domain. But I felt it was also too much cost, so I dicided to look for the cheepest one else where. It come an idea, let me buy a domain name without DNS which cost 25,000 Tsh from [Extream Webhostin Tanzania](http://www.extremewebtechnologies.com/). So the problem comes now, no website with without DNS setting. How I found free DNS for my domain name ? I search it on google and I found this tool [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) to resolve a DNS settings for me.
