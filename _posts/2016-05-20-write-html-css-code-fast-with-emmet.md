	As a web developer, we have always been searching for a tool and editors to increase our workflow and productivity in coding and programing. if your the one, here is a solution to improve your coding.

Some of my friend asking me how I get a project with a thousand line of codes? (Said Muhama & Nopex) among them. but today I come with this simple method to archieve the super fast coding with [Emmet](http://emmet.io/)  follow me here...

Emmet is the extending development of [ZenCoding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_Coding), which is written purely with JavaScript. While in this demonstration Iâ€™m going to use Sublime Text, Emmet is also available for many code editors including TextMate, Coda, Eclipse, Notepad++, and Adobe DreamWeaver.

## **Installing Emmet**

	Head over to this page to find and [download Emmet](http://emmet.io/download/) for your code editor. If you are using Sublime Text, like I am, Emmet can be installed easily through Package Control. Once installed, you may need to restart your text editor.

## **Writing HTML with Emmet**

	Most current editors probably have a similar built-in functionality. For example, in Sublime Text we simply write ``` <ul> ``` and hit the Tab key, it will automatically expand into a complete unordered list with the ``` <li> ``` element.

  To test your Emmet tool if its working correctly just let test this HTML tags
